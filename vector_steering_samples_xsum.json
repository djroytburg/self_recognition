who fled to Israel after he was exposed as a paedophile - was jailed for 13 years.\nTodros Grynhaus was deported by the Israeli authorities to face justice in the UK, with his conviction for sex offences against girls leading to a change in attitudes in the Haredi Jewish community.\nThe case prompted the UK's Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, to urge members to report child sex abuse.\nThe court had heard that both women who testified against Grynhaus in the case had been \"ostracised\" by their community as a result of speaking out about their ordeal.\nFor young Muslim girls, the price of speaking out about child sexual abuse can also be high, with many reluctant to report such abuse because of the fear that it would bring shame on them and their family.\nSexual and physical abuse at Islamic religious schools, known as madrassas, has also resulted in some prosecutions in recent years, although often victims still hesitate to come forward with such allegations.\nMany religious organisations will find themselves being closely scrutinised in the national independent inquiry into child sexual abuse,  chaired by New Zealand judge Lowell Goddard.\nThe survivors of such abuse hope that the inquiry will prove itself truly independent, and help ensure that abusers will not be able to rely on their own congregations or religious leaders to protect them -

It's important for me to select the better summary for my records.\n\nArticle:\nHe would go upstairs, on the premise that he was saying a prayer with his niece, then sexually abuse her.\nNow in her 30s, Karen wasn't understood when she first told her parents what her uncle, Mark Sewell, was doing.\nSewell was also the son of a trusted older member of the local Jehovah's Witnesses congregation, known as an elder.\nChristian churches, as well as other religions, have faced claims of child abuse.\nBut what is striking about the Jehovah's Witnesses is their explicit policy of dealing with abuse in-house.\nBecause of their practice of following the Bible literally, they insist there must be two witnesses to a crime, often not the case in child abuse cases.\nHowever, in Karen's case a second witness did come forward: Wendy, a family friend and fellow member of the Barry congregation in south Wales. She had been raped by the same man.\nWhen she reported the crime to elders, Wendy was made to describe it in minute detail to a group of older men.\nLater, she had to give her account again in the same room as Sewell.\nAfterwards, the elders told her that as it was only her account against that of Sewell, nothing more could be done.\nThis bringing together of the accused and the accuser in a \"judicial committee\" is a common feature of Jehovah's Witnesses' justice.\nKaren, still a teenager at the time, was put through the process.\nThe elders also ruled that their separate accusations didn't constitute the required two witnesses.\nDespite a pattern of predatory sexual behaviour, it took more than two decades to bring Wendy and Karen's abuser to justice.\nHe is now serving a 14-year prison sentence.\nHis punishment from the Jehovah's Witnesses? There wasn't one.\nEven when the case came to court, the organisation was reluctant to co-operate.\nKaren's father, John Viney, who was also an elder in the Barry congregation, says that elders who knew of Sewell's conduct and were asked to give statements or evidence in court did not want to get involved.\nIn a programme for Radio 4's The Report, we have identified this lack of co-operation in several other similar cases.\nConfidential documents from the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of Britain - the official name for the Jehovah's Witnesses - that we have seen are explicit about the best way to deal with such matters being within the congregation.\nNowhere in the hundreds of pages we have seen are elders told that they must go to the police, even if the perpetrator confesses, unless state or national law makes it mandatory to report such allegations.\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses' UK leadership declined to talk to us for the programme.\nIn a statement, they said they were appealing against a recent High Court ruling in the UK that awarded substantial damages against the organisation for failing to protect a child from sexual abuse by a paedophile.\nTheir statement also insists that the organisation does take child abuse extremely seriously.\nKaren Morgan and Wendy are now pursuing a civil claim against the organisation, hoping that further financial penalty may force the leadership of the Jehovah's Witnesses to change its policies.\nFor both of them, what made it even harder was the sense that belonging to the Jehovah's Witnesses was part of an all-encompassing lifestyle, with members encouraged to socialise and marry within the group.\nThe organisation has some eight million members around the world, but as Karen found to her cost, those who decide to have a boyfriend or girlfriend who is not a member may find themselves \"disfellowshipped\" or shunned.\nJehovah's Witnesses are not the only religious organisation to try to deal with allegations of sexual abuse in-house.\nFor many decades, that was the preferred method of the Roman Catholic Church, which has since reformed its child safeguarding policies following numerous court cases in the US and Europe against priests for the sexual abuse of children.\nOther churches have also tightened up their child safeguarding policies, with the Methodist Church conducting its own recent inquiry into abuse allegations dating back to 1950.\nThat inquiry has led to calls for the Church of England to hold a fresh internal inquiry of its own, separately from the overarching national public inquiry that has just begun, and from the investigation it published in 2010, which critics termed inadequate.\nHowever, it is the more closed religious communities and new religious movements where it remains hardest for the victims of such abuse to speak out and gain access to secular justice, although awareness of the issue is growing.\nOnly this month, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish scholar from Manchester - who fled to Israel after he was exposed as a paedophile - was jailed for 13 years.\nTodros Grynhaus was deported by the Israeli authorities to face justice in the UK, with his conviction for sex offences against girls leading to a change in attitudes in the Haredi Jewish community.\nThe case prompted the UK's Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, to urge members to report child sex abuse.\nThe court had heard that both women who testified against Grynhaus in the case had been \"ostracised\" by their community as a result of speaking out about their ordeal.\nFor young Muslim girls, the price of speaking out about child sexual abuse can also be high, with many reluctant to report such abuse because of the fear that it would bring shame on them and their family.\nSexual and physical abuse at Islamic religious schools, known as madrassas, has also resulted in some prosecutions in recent years, although often victims still hesitate to come forward with such allegations.\nMany religious organisations will find themselves being closely scrutinised in the national independent inquiry into child sexual abuse,  chaired by New Zealand judge Lowell Goddard.\nThe survivors of such abuse hope that the inquiry will prove itself truly independent, and help ensure that abusers will not be able to rely on their own congregations or religious leaders to protect them - whatever their faith.\nThe Inquiry will investigate a wide range of institutions including:\nLocal authorities\nThe police\nThe Crown Prosecution Service\nThe Immigration Service\nThe BBC\nThe armed forces\nSchools\nHospitals\nChildren's homes\nChurches, mosques and other religious organisations\nCharities and voluntary organisations\nFull details of the inquiry\nCaroline Wyatt's investigation will be broadcast in Radio 4's The Report at 20:00 BST on Thursday, 23 July.\n\nSummary1:\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses' explicit policy of dealing with abuse in-house, including the requirement of two witnesses to a crime, has led to delayed justice for victims.\n\nSummary2:\nA Jehovah's Witnesses elder, Mark Sewell, was convicted of child abuse after a 20-year investigation, but the organization's in-house policy and lack of cooperation hindered justice for his victims.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

It's important for me to select the better summary for my records.\n\nArticle:\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIt's 1997 and ID7 television are filming at Dunkirk rugby club in northern France. Their subject is in his mid-30s, has a full head of hair and is strangely familiar. He's not French, but he's fluent. Only when the cameraman asks him to say his name does the penny drop.\n\"Je m'appelle Vernon Anthony Cotter.\"\nFor four and a half minutes he doesn't miss a beat - and why would he? Cotter had been in the country for years by then. Four seasons playing in the back row with Rumilly in the south-east, two years with Lourdes in the foothills of the Pyrenees, a year with Saint-Junien in west-central France and he would soon kick on for the small southern village of Castelnau-Riviere-Basse, where he played and coached while briefly contemplating a new life as a winemaker.\nCotter is now sitting in Murrayfield talking about the past, the present, the future. The New Zealander has been Scotland coach for 31 Test matches - 16 victories, 15 defeats, nine of which were by seven points or less, five of them by three or less.\nHe's given a first cap to 26 players. Eighteen of the squad he has just named for the Six Nations have appeared on his watch.\nHe has just five more Tests before France reclaims him. Montpellier await. Time for reflection, then. Time to remember where Cotter came from and where he has taken Scotland in his two and a half eventful years.\nCotter is big into culture. Rugby culture. He learned about it first as a player with Counties in New Zealand but a lot of his knowledge came in those early years in France. \"I used to think I was a reasonably physical player, but I was a baby,\" he says.\nI understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here\n\"I learned a lot about character and defending the jersey. You couldn't help but get swept away. The French flair - I used to laugh at that. It wasn't true. Overlaps were created because two forward packs were generally having a good whack at each other.\"\nHe tells a story about a derby match from the mid-90s, his own Lourdes team versus Pau. No love lost between them. In their previous meeting there'd been \"scuffles\" and Lourdes had come off second best.\n\"Our players were doing cartwheels going on to the paddock,\" Cotter recounts. \"The coach said, 'Right boys, tactics for the day. The first five [eighth] kick it straight into the stand and we run up and punch them.' That's what happened. I had somebody who had given me a gentle tickle in the away game and I managed to line him up.\n\"There was an all-out brawl, but no penalty.

Only when the cameraman asks him to say his name does the penny drop.\n\"Je m'appelle Vernon Anthony Cotter.\"\nFor four and a half minutes he doesn't miss a beat - and why would he? Cotter had been in the country for years by then. Four seasons playing in the back row with Rumilly in the south-east, two years with Lourdes in the foothills of the Pyrenees, a year with Saint-Junien in west-central France and he would soon kick on for the small southern village of Castelnau-Riviere-Basse, where he played and coached while briefly contemplating a new life as a winemaker.\nCotter is now sitting in Murrayfield talking about the past, the present, the future. The New Zealander has been Scotland coach for 31 Test matches - 16 victories, 15 defeats, nine of which were by seven points or less, five of them by three or less.\nHe's given a first cap to 26 players. Eighteen of the squad he has just named for the Six Nations have appeared on his watch.\nHe has just five more Tests before France reclaims him. Montpellier await. Time for reflection, then. Time to remember where Cotter came from and where he has taken Scotland in his two and a half eventful years.\nCotter is big into culture. Rugby culture. He learned about it first as a player with Counties in New Zealand but a lot of his knowledge came in those early years in France. \"I used to think I was a reasonably physical player, but I was a baby,\" he says.\nI understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here\n\"I learned a lot about character and defending the jersey.

No love lost between them. In their previous meeting there'd been \"scuffles\" and Lourdes had come off second best.\n\"Our players were doing cartwheels going on to the paddock,\" Cotter recounts. \"The coach said, 'Right boys, tactics for the day. The first five [eighth] kick it straight into the stand and we run up and punch them.' That's what happened. I had somebody who had given me a gentle tickle in the away game and I managed to line him up.\n\"There was an all-out brawl, but no penalty.

A dialogue which is more necessary in these days than ever before.\"\nThe concert also included Michael Torke's Javelin, which was originally performed at the opening ceremony of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and a hand-picked selection of young singers performing Vaughan Williams' Serenade to Music - a tribute to Henry Wood, whose name is synonymous with the Proms.\nIn keeping with tradition, the concert - and the 2016 season - closed with Rule Britannia, Land of Hope and Glory and Jerusalem.\nAround the UK, classical music fans were able to join in the celebrations at Proms in the Park events; with special appearances by pianist Ruth McGinley and soprano Lesley Garret in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\nThirteen-year-old Gwydion Rhys was given the opportunity to conduct the BBC National Orchestra of Wales in a performance of Ride of the Valkyries at the Welsh Prom, in Colwyn Bay.\nBritain's Got Talent winners Collabro appeared at the Scottish leg, in Glasgow Green; while London's line-up included Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, Rick Astley, Sir James Galway, Tim Minchin and the cast of Matilda The Musical.\nThe events brought the two month-long Proms season to a close, after more than 100 concerts.\nHighlights included the  Sim\u00c3\u00b3n Bolivar Orchestra, from Caracas, who put on a colourful, exotic evening, full of evocations of Latin America; and  a spine-tingling programme of Steve Reich, performed on the roof of a Peckham car park.\nA late night Prom paid tribute to the life and music of David Bowie, with mixed results; while Quincy Jones and Strictly Come Dancing were also honoured with their own programmes.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.\n\nSummary1:\nA virtual orchestra of 1,200 performers was showcased at the Proms in the Park events, featuring a high-pitched rendition of Rule Britannia and a mix of international music.\n\nSummary2:\nThe BBC's Last Night of the Proms featured a virtual orchestra, a high-pitched rendition of Rule Britannia, and a diverse lineup of performers celebrating music's universal language.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

Patients have to come to them.\nThe mathematicians envisage a new type of detector small enough to ride in an ambulance.\nIt will be a helmet containing microwave antennae, and will fire the microwave through the patient's brain and receive the resulting signals.\nThe results will be sent to a supercomputing centre, which is where the maths comes in.\nThe techniques developed at Strathclyde and on the continent can produce a 3D image of the brain - and its injury - within 15 minutes.\nThe sensor hardware is being developed by the Austrian imaging company EMTensor.\nAt the moment it exists as two prototypes in a hospital in Vienna.\nEach is a cylindrical chamber consisting of five rings, each of 32 antennae.\nThe next step will be to make the device portable.\nOne of the mathematics team is Dr Victorita Dolean, a Reader in Strathclyde's Department of Mathematics and Statistics.\n\"Our aim will be to produce a portable and less expensive device that can detect strokes in real time,\" she says.\n\"The idea would be that we'd send these electromagnetic waves into the brain and then the properties of the tissues - which will be healthy or sick - will be detected by measurements of the data on this helmet.\n\"The data will be sent to a supercomputing centre.\n\"We have designed some open source software that is able to reconstruct, precisely and in real time, an image of the brain and then send it back to the doctors to interpret this data and make the diagnosis.\"\nThe team's mathematical approach has already won the team the Bull-Joseph Fourier Prize for excellence in numerical simulation and data processing.\n\"We could not have done this a few years ago because we needed powerful advances in electronics, in computer science, in algorithms, in mathematics,\" Dr Dolean says.\nShe now expects the sensor helmets to be in the field in two to four years - not just in ambulances, but anywhere they might be needed.\n\"They'll be cheap and portable and able to act as an emergency device,\" she says.\nAnd that quick, on the spot diagnosis could mean survival for stroke victims.\n\nSummary1:\nMathematicians at the University of Strathclyde are developing a portable and less expensive device that can detect strokes in real time using microwave technology, potentially saving lives.\n\nSummary2:\nResearchers are developing a portable, helmet-like device that uses microwave signals to create a 3D image of a patient's brain within 15 minutes, aiding in real-time stroke diagnosis.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

It's important for me to select the better summary for my records.\n\nArticle:\nMOTD2 pundit Danny Murphy expands on his TV analysis of the part his former Tottenham team-mate Jermain Defoe played in Sunderland's vital derby win over Newcastle.\nWhen I realised his starting position was on the right wing in a 4-3-3 formation, I was surprised to say the least.\nI know Jermain well from training and playing with and against him, and he does not particularly like playing in those wide areas - he certainly did not enjoy it back in the day.\nThat is understandable because he is a goalscorer and he lives off the goals he gets. He does not normally like being in areas of the pitch where he cannot affect the game in a positive way.\nBut obviously he was asked to play a different role by Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat because of their circumstances and he did a brilliant job for the team.\nI have never seen Defoe work as hard as he did to contribute defensively on Sunday - he tracked back on the left too and at one point he was making sliding tackles near his own corner flag, which was a first.\nHe is 32 now and he will not want to be doing that permanently. But knowing him like I do, if he is asked to do any kind of job for his team to help them stay in the Premier League then he will always give it his all.\nI do not think playing him there gets the best out of him, but it worked for Sunderland on Sunday.\nUltimately, Defoe only had one shot at goal in his 80 minutes on the pitch, but it was a world-class finish to win Sunderland the game and three vital points.\nThat is what they signed him for, and you could see from his celebration how much it meant to him.\nI have played in midfield behind Defoe and he is a very special talent in that he does not solely rely on through-balls.\nIf you get the ball to his feet, he has got the capability around the box to beat people himself and shoot from range with real power.\nDefoe has pace and thrives on being put through too of course, but one of the reasons he has scored as many goals as he has done in his career is that there are so many different elements to his game.\nYes he will get in the six-yard box to score you a tap-in but he can create goals for himself and, as Newcastle found out, score from distance as well.\nBefore that goal, he had not scored for six games which will have been hurting him because he is not used to it.\nBut I know that it will not have knocked his confidence because he is the sort of player that never loses faith in himself, and for good reason.\nThat bit of class he produced against Newcastle was the kind of moment of brilliance I have come to expect from him after playing with and against him down the years.\nDefoe's appetite was typical of the rest of the Sunderland team.\nWhat Dick Advocaat's side lack in quality, they make up for in physicality and endeavour which is a massive positive for them.\nThey have got some powerful players and they look fit, which is an often overlooked factor at this stage of the season.\nAgainst Newcastle, both of their full-backs - Billy Jones and Patrick van Aanholt - did brilliantly, flying up the wings.\nThey also have a few clever players, like Jordi Gomez and Seb Larsson, who have been in this position at the bottom of the table before and will be used to the pressure involved when you are fighting relegation.\nFrom what I saw of them in this game, they have got enough about them to beat the drop.\nBut that is mainly because of the quality Defoe gives them in the final third. He could be the difference between them staying up, or not.\nDanny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\n\nSummary1:\nFormer Tottenham player Jermain Defoe played a crucial role in Sunderland's win over Newcastle, adapting to a different position and scoring the winning goal.\n\nSummary2:\nFormer Tottenham teammate Danny Murphy praises Jermain Defoe's selfless performance in Sunderland's win over Newcastle, where he scored a world-class goal to seal the victory.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

It's important for me to select the better summary for my records.\n\nArticle:\nOfficers are searching a residential address in north-west London where they say a 60-year-old man was detained.\nMr Hussain has lived in the UK since 1991, saying his life would be at risk if he returned to Pakistan.\nHis party, which controls Karachi, has urged supporters to stay calm amid outbreaks of violence there.\nThe British and Pakistani authorities have in the past expressed concerns that any arrest of Altaf Hussain could lead to violent protests in Karachi.\nShootings have been reported from some parts of Pakistan's largest city, which BBC correspondents say is tense.\nTraffic jams were reported in Karachi and other cities in Sindh province as businesses closed and people headed home fearing violence.\nOne man in the city, who gave his name as Tahir, told the BBC that MQM supporters were firing guns in the streets and setting fire to any shops which remained open.\nAnother, Nabil, said there had been \"turmoil\" and \"massive confusion\" about whether Altaf Hussain had been arrested or not.\nKarachi in fear after Altaf Hussain arrest\nPakistan's powerful but absent politician\nKarachi has been wracked by violence - much of it politically motivated.\nSecurity is being tightened around the British mission in the city, which has been closed temporarily, and other buildings.\nA Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) spokesman in London, Nadeem Nusrat, confirmed the arrest and urged its supporters to \"maintain peace at all costs\".\n\"The police arrived with a search warrant and wanted to question Mr Hussain regarding allegations of money laundering,\" he said in a statement.\nMr Hussain had been \"very unwell\" for the past few days and was getting ready to go to hospital when the police arrived, the statement added.\nPolice later confimed that Mr Hussain had been escorted to a hospital appointment while still in custody.\nFor many years now, Altaf Hussain's MQM has had a bloc of about 20 members in the National Assembly, making him a powerful figure both in Pakistan's biggest city Karachi and in the country as a whole. Remarkably he has led the party from London for over 20 years for fear that going back home could result in legal cases or a physical threat to his security.\nAs well as his solid electoral base in Karachi, Mr Hussain has a powerful party organisation in the city which is often accused of extorting money from businesses and using violence - or the threat of it - to get its way.\nFor years the British authorities tolerated the MQM being based in London. In fact British diplomats sought to take advantage of the situation by trying to influence the party to help achieve British objectives in Pakistan. But the mood changed when a senior MQM party member Imran Farooq was murdered in London in 2010.\nMr Hussain, his party, and some of his associates and relatives are currently the subject of a number of British investigations.\nOne is looking into the question of whether in his televised speeches he has incited violence in Pakistan, charges Mr Hussain denies. Another is into whether the MQM has paid its UK taxes correctly.\nThe most high-profile investigation followed the 2010 murder in London of a senior MQM leader Imran Farooq. No-one has been formally charged with his killing.\nThe MQM is often accused of extorting money from businesses in Karachi and shipping the money to the UK, charges the party also denies.\n\nSummary1:\nBritish police have arrested Altaf Hussain, a 60-year-old Pakistani politician living in London, amid concerns of violent protests in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city.\n\nSummary2:\nThe arrest of Altaf Hussain in London has led to fear and violence in Karachi, with his party, the MQM, urging supporters to stay calm.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

It's important for me to select the better summary for my records.\n\nArticle:\nThe winning film, I Daniel Blake, marks the 13th time that Loach, the director of more than 50 movies, has competed at the event. It's also exactly 10 years since he won the same prize for his 2006 Irish drama The Wind That Shakes The Barley, starring Cillian Murphy.\nLoach uses I, Daniel Blake to expose the welfare system in the UK, and says he wants the film \"to break audience's hearts, but also to make them angry\".\nDaniel Blake, played by stand-up comedian Dave Johns, is an older man living in Newcastle who, because of a heart attack, can no longer do his job.\nHowever, a mobility test by the Department of Work and Pensions declares him fit for work and while he waits for his appeal, Daniel Blake can only claim Jobseekers Allowance.\nHis inability to take any work offered means his money is stopped, and he begins to go hungry.\nLoach, a social campaigner for most of his career, believes the current criteria for claiming benefits in the UK is \"a Kafka-esque, Catch 22 situation designed to frustrate and humiliate the claimant to such an extent that they drop out of the system and stop pursuing their right to ask for support if necessary\".\n\"The state's attitude is not an accident,\" he claims.\n\"The poverty, the indignity, the humiliation people go through is consciously done.\n\"The state is knowingly inefficient or cruel, knowing that people will be driven to frustration, despair, hunger and possible suicide.\n\"Claimants are portrayed as 'scroungers' in the media but research has found that less than 1% of claims for benefits are fraudulent.\n\"That's certainly less than the figures for tax evasion, for example.\n\"But there's an attitude that suggests that if you're poor, it's your fault. If you are out of a job, it's your fault. It's done to get the numbers down and the most vulnerable in our society are suffering as a result.\"\nHalf a century ago, Ken Loach wrote the screenplay for the BBC play Cathy Come Home, which examined homelessness in Britain in 1966, and the director says his latest film \"is a snapshot of how life can be lived in Britain in 2016\".\n\"We wanted to explore the human consequences of welfare policy in terms of relationships, and who people become through these policies.\"\nLoach and his long-time collaborator, writer Paul Laverty, spent several months visiting British cities such as Stoke, Newcastle, Liverpool and Glasgow, meeting people seeking work, or on low-paid or zero-hour contracts.\n\"We started in my home town of Nuneaton and met a young lad there who was sleeping on a mattress in a charity home.\n\"He was doing the odd bit of work on zero-hour contracts, he'd given up on benefits - he said it was too humiliating.\n\"He hadn't worked for a couple of weeks, and the week before he hadn't eaten for four days.\n\"I opened his fridge and there was nothing in it - nothing at all. And this was one of the first people we encountered.\"\nLoach and Laverty say they also based a pivotal scene in the film, where a mother arrives at a food bank having not eaten for days, on a real anecdote from one of the centres they visited in Glasgow.\n\"Food banks have been praised by the state without any sense of shame at all and yet it's appalling in 2016 that people are having to make the choice between food and heating, which is common.\n\"After the war in 1945, we were desperately poor in Britain, but there is no way people would have been starving, their communities wouldn't have let them.\n\"That we now have this situation is testament to the policy of individualism that successive governments have pursued.\n\"It's shocking that we are apparently such a wealthy nation with such grotesque wealth at the top and such desperate poverty and fear at the very bottom.\"\nThe film has won widespread acclaim from critics, with Variety magazine calling it \"one of Loach's finest films, a drama of tender devastation, a work of scalding and moving relevance\".\nBut despite its concentration on the UK welfare system, Loach, who will be 80 next month, insists that the movie also applies to an international audience.\n\"There is a conscious cruelty in the way we organise our lives now which means the most vulnerable people in society, such as the disabled, are caught in this unfair situation.\n\"They are often unable to live with dignity, and instead suffer pain and deep despair.\n\"It's deeply shocking that this is happening at the heart of our world.\"\nI, Daniel Blake will be released in the UK later this year\n\nSummary1:\nKen Loach's film \"I, Daniel Blake\" exposes the UK's welfare system, highlighting the Kafka-esque treatment of claimants and the devastating consequences of poverty, hunger, and humiliation.\n\nSummary2:\nThe film \"I, Daniel Blake\" by director Ken Loach exposes the UK welfare system's cruelty and its impact on the most vulnerable in society, winning widespread acclaim from critics.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

It's having your own knife and fork in your hands, because we have to feed John.\"\nAccording to the charity Carers Wales, respite provision is already in short supply, but the cuts being made by local authorities will limit support even further.\n\"For individual families if a respite service which they've relied on gets cut, that's a real problem,\" said director Roz Williamson.\n\"But for most families, the problem is that they can't get access to anything - so the qualification for getting any help from a local authority keeps going up and up and up - so most families get nothing.\"\nA consultation on the future of respite care in Wales has recently closed, following an independent review which said there was \"a strong case for funding more outcome focussed respite services in Wales\".\nThe Welsh Government said it recognised \"the important role that respite care has in supporting individuals and families at what can be an extremely difficult time\".\nA spokesperson said: \"We are protecting the social services budget through the local government settlement. Funding for social services will increase in cash terms by \u00a335m by 2013-14.\n\"It is a matter for local authorities to ensure they have necessary respite placements.\"\n\nSummary1:\nSeveral councils in Wales have reduced their planned spending on respite care, leading to concerns about the impact on vulnerable groups and carers.\n\nSummary2:\nCuts to respite care budgets in Wales have raised concerns that vulnerable groups will be denied essential support, with some councils reducing their spending by over 80%.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

It's important for me to select the better summary for my records.\n\nArticle:\nThe phrase \"rapid rise through the ranks\" is a standard line in profiles of political leaders. But it's rarely as speedy as in Natalie Bennett's case.\nThe Australian-born former Guardian journalist woke up on New Year's Day 2006 and decided she wanted to do something to change the world.\nAfter pondering her options (should she get involved with an NGO or the UN?) she joined the Green Party. Within six short years she had become its leader.\nThree years after that she was sharing a stage with the prime minister and other party leaders in a televised general election debate.\nHer sudden arrival on the frontline of British politics was all the more remarkable because she had never won an election, other than the one that had made her party leader.\nHer first aim when she took on the job was to insert the Green Party - routinely ignored or patronised by the mainstream media - into the national conversation.\nBut when media outlets finally began calling, on the back of a surge in support for the party, she sometimes found it difficult to get her message across in a suitably snappy way.\nHer vision for the party was to show how \"economic and environmental justice are indivisible\", she explains, \"the idea that tackling environmental problems isn't an add-on luxury\".\nIt was \"not a easy concept to get across\", she confesses. \"I still don't think I've got the 12 second soundbite. But I am going to keep working on it.\"\n\"It's a classic Shakespearean thing,\" she says of her struggles with the broadcast media. \"It's both my strength and my weakness that I answer the question.\"\nBut, she adds, \"when you get asked a stupid question, it's rather hard to know what to do at that point. And I guess I get tangled up in my desire to answer a question, even when it's a really stupid question\".\nDid she get asked a lot of stupid questions?\n\"Yes.\"\nAsked for an example, she ponders for a minute, before highlighting an interview with the BBC's very own John Humphrys, which led to her having \"to spend time, valuable peak time, explaining how the interviewer got the question wrong. And listeners don't particularly like that because it's all technical and boring and you are arguing with the interviewer but if it's entirely on the wrong track you have to\".\nShe says she has some sympathy with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has also attracted criticism for broadcast interviews in which he has deviated from the usual prepared soundbites.\n\"The focus on the individual is a problem for British politics and it's very uncomfortable when the focus is on you,\" she says, arguing that the media in continental Europe are focused more on policies than personalities and trivia.\n\"I am not complaining - you have to work within those limits,\" she adds, but she believes British politics is \"broken\" and the media must take its share of the blame.\n\"There should be some pressure on the journalist to ask better, more sensible questions,\" she argues.\nThere was nothing particularly stupid about the question that prompted her darkest moment in a radio studio, however, when she struggled over several excruciating minutes, punctuated by coughing fits, to answer a question from LBC's Nick Ferrari on her party's housing policy.\nShe was quick to hold her hands up afterwards, apologising to supporters and blaming her sub-par performance, in the heat of the general election campaign, on \"brain freeze\".\n\"That was a very tough moment. And of course you take a bit of a punch to the stomach.\n\"But then a few weeks later I was up on the leader debates, able to look David Cameron in the eye and challenge him about his failure to welcome Syrian refugees to Britain, and that was one of the best moments.\n\"My great problem on that day was that I was in no way well enough to actually be doing anything. I'd had about three and a half hours sleep and I'd been throwing up most of the night. I should have just pulled the day but that's partly a function of how we got to that point.\n\"We weren't used to getting a lot of media attention and it was very, very hard to turn media attention down.\"\nOne of Ms Bennett's proudest moments came at the end of the BBC leaders debate when she joined Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in a \"group hug\", while Labour leader Ed Miliband looked on awkwardly.\nThis felt like a watershed moment for women in politics, she says, sending out the message \"that politics can not just be 'dog eat dog', it can be people agreeing on some things and disagreeing on others but supporting each other\".\nAs a lifelong feminist, she is particularly pleased to have been told by \"lots of young women\" that they had been inspired by the \"group hug\", which she stresses had not been planned in advance.\n\"I hope and think that that moment really, in 15 years' time, 20 years' time, we might see a whole crop of MPs down the road who will reference that moment as the time they decided they were going to try and get there.\"\nMs Bennett's decision to pitch for the anti-austerity vote, positioning the Greens as a left-wing alternative to what was then Ed Miliband's Labour Party, struck a chord with idealistic young people who felt alienated by mainstream politics, and led to a surge in party membership.\nBut then Jeremy Corbyn came along and shifted Labour firmly to the left, inspiring idealistic activists to join his party in numbers the Greens could only dream about.\nHasn't the Green Party, which had a mixed set of results in May's elections, losing four councillors in England and failing to make progress in Wales but getting its best ever result in London, been crowded out of the picture by Labour?\nMs Bennett insists this is not the case, arguing that there is a \"very clear distinction\" between the Greens and Labour on a range of issues - from nuclear weapons to fracking - and that voters know exactly what they are getting when they vote Green.\nBut she is also open to the idea of a \"progressive alliance\" at the next general election, with local Green Parties potentially making electoral pacts with Labour, Plaid Cymru, the SNP or other parties who broadly share their outlook.\nShe remains a passionate advocate of electoral reform. The Green Party fielded a record number of general election candidates in 2015, standing in 93% of constituencies, and gaining more than a million votes. By rights, she argues, the party should have 25 MPs. She believes the case for scrapping what she sees as Britain's outdated first-past-the-post electoral system is gaining ground in the country.\nShe says she has had an \"amazing\" four years as leader, and has no regrets, believing the party is in better shape now, having quadrupled its membership and gained a foothold in the national debate on issues such as welfare and the economy, than when she took over.\nBut she is also keen to stress that she will not be leaving politics.\n\"I'm aiming to turn former leader into a role in its own right, to keep travelling the country, supporting local parties, doing media. Leadership is a role we can share around. It's not you become leader, that's the pinnacle, and then you disappear.\"\nAsked if she has any advice for the next leader, she says trust the party membership.\nAnything else?\n\"Work out how to answer stupid questions,\" she laughs. \"I still don't quite know the answer to that one myself.\"\n\nSummary1:\nNatalie Bennett, former leader of the Green Party, rose to prominence in six years, but struggled with the media's focus on soundbites and personalities, hindering her ability to convey her party's message.\n\nSummary2:\nNatalie Bennett's rapid rise to leadership of the Green Party and her struggles with media attention and soundbite politics are highlighted in a recent interview.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

In fact, anger is at the peak right now.\"\nDespite a relatively strong economy and a string of financial incentives announced by Beijing to boost popular support in the semi-autonomous city, Hong Kong is a much more restive place than it was five years ago, when Mr Hu last came to visit, in a blaze of pre-Olympic glory.\nAhead of the visit, Hong Kong's census bureau publicised data that showed inequality had widened to its highest level in three decades.\nAccording to US government rankings, Hong Kong's wealth gap now outstrips all other developed nations. It ranks behind highly unequal countries such as Colombia, Haiti and Sierra Leone.\nMonthly incomes for Hong Kong's poorest have fallen by about 8% over the past five years, while salaries for the richest have grown by about 25%, according to the newest census data.\nSze Lai Shan, a social worker with the Society for Community Organisation, said as a result of integration with the mainland, Hong Kong's economic structure had changed.\n\"The factories have moved to mainland China, and the government believes in the trickle-down theory where everyone benefits from overall economic development. So they have done little for the poor,\" she said during a visit to a cramped sub-divided flat.\nThe first-floor flat is in the shadow of the glitzy commercial district of Causeway Bay.\nInside two dozen people - mostly single middle-age or elderly men - reside in enclosed wooden bunks the size of a single bed.\nLocals call these coffin homes, because each is slightly larger than the size of a coffin.

Chinese officials have promised a proper investigation, but Hong Kong people remain sceptical.\nAlthough Mr Hu's visit in 2007 coincided with pro-democracy protests, the political climate in China and Hong Kong was different at that time.\nFive years ago, China seemed relatively open to democratic reform, as it promised organisers who awarded Beijing the 2008 games.\nRestrictions were eased for foreign and Hong Kong journalists. Activists such as AIDS campaigner Hu Jia and pro-democracy campaigner Liu Xiaobo were given relative free rein to air their views.\nThe country appeared to be edging ever so slightly closer to Hong Kong's core democratic values of clean government, the rule of law and freedom of speech.\nBut this year the political atmosphere is strained as Mr Hu arrives bearing financial incentives to drum up public support. He is expected to stay until Sunday.\n\nSummary1:\nHong Kong is experiencing its worst social unrest since the handover, with a widening wealth gap, rising property prices, and widespread mistrust of the Chinese government.\n\nSummary2:\nIntegration with mainland China has led to economic success in Hong Kong, but has also widened the wealth gap and fueled mistrust and anger towards the Beijing government.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

It's important for me to select the better summary for my records.\n\nArticle:\nIntegration with the mainland has brought Hong Kong much success as a global financial centre but it has also created problems.\nThose problems seem to be at their worst at any time since the handover, according to a series of surveys and opinion polls.\nThe gap between Hong Kong's rich and poor is at a 30-year high, property rental prices have risen to record levels and residents are upset by daily news reports on corrupt lives of officials at the highest levels of Chinese government.\nAn independent poll shows the Hong Kong public's mistrust of the Chinese\u00a0government stands at a post handover high, largely because of a number of political scandals.\nThese include the sacking of senior Communist Party official Bo Xilai, the plight of human rights activist Chen Guangcheng and, most seriously, the suspicious death of Tiananmen Square dissident Li Wangyang in June.\n\"What happens in China very closely affects Hong Kong people, because we're all ethnic Chinese,\" said Frank Lee, a pollster at the University of Hong Kong's public opinion programme.\n\"That's probably the reason why, at this moment, many people don't trust the Beijing government. In fact, anger is at the peak right now.\"\nDespite a relatively strong economy and a string of financial incentives announced by Beijing to boost popular support in the semi-autonomous city, Hong Kong is a much more restive place than it was five years ago, when Mr Hu last came to visit, in a blaze of pre-Olympic glory.\nAhead of the visit, Hong Kong's census bureau publicised data that showed inequality had widened to its highest level in three decades.\nAccording to US government rankings, Hong Kong's wealth gap now outstrips all other developed nations. It ranks behind highly unequal countries such as Colombia, Haiti and Sierra Leone.\nMonthly incomes for Hong Kong's poorest have fallen by about 8% over the past five years, while salaries for the richest have grown by about 25%, according to the newest census data.\nSze Lai Shan, a social worker with the Society for Community Organisation, said as a result of integration with the mainland, Hong Kong's economic structure had changed.\n\"The factories have moved to mainland China, and the government believes in the trickle-down theory where everyone benefits from overall economic development. So they have done little for the poor,\" she said during a visit to a cramped sub-divided flat.\nThe first-floor flat is in the shadow of the glitzy commercial district of Causeway Bay.\nInside two dozen people - mostly single middle-age or elderly men - reside in enclosed wooden bunks the size of a single bed.\nLocals call these coffin homes, because each is slightly larger than the size of a coffin. Rent ranges from HK$1,000 ($128, \u00a383) to HK$1,400 per bunk.\nLee Chi Wai, a 57-year-old cleaner with a warm smile, lives with his worldly possessions - a tiny television, a few compact disks, some plastic shelves and several shirts - directly below Wong Ching Po, 60.\nWhen not working, the two men watch television and engage in friendly banter. Both decry the lack of opportunities and inadequate public housing in Hong Kong.\n\"It's very hard to find a job,\" said Mr Lee. \"Most companies have moved to China. Those that stay want temporary workers not permanent staff. When the contract is over, I have to look for another job. That is why life is hard.\"\nFollowing the release of the census figures, Hong Kong's incoming Chief Executive CY Leung - who is to be sworn in on Sunday - announced he would chair a new preparatory task force to tackle poverty.\nBesides anger over social inequality, Mr Hu will be greeted by two large-scale democracy protests over the weekend.\nThe rally on Sunday is the annual human rights demonstration that traditionally starts at Victoria Park and ends at the Hong Kong government office in Admiralty.\n\"Hong Kong people are very uptight about freedom issues on the mainland, because they reflect on us.

Since discovering these errors, we have taken urgent steps to ensure that figures will in future be subjected to rigorous quality control.\"\nThe Howard League for Penal Reform said the statement came two years after it published research showing that about 20,000 prisoners were being kept in overcrowded conditions.\nChairman Frances Crook said: \"This is a timely written statement, and we welcome the new culture of honesty and accountability at the Ministry of Justice.\n\"Simple logic dictates that if two or three prisoners are sharing a cell designed for one, then all those people are being held in overcrowded conditions. We are pleased that the government's figures will now reflect this, as the Howard League has made this point repeatedly for many years.\n\"Holding men in overcrowded cells with nothing to do all day is never going to help them become law-abiding citizens on release, and it is important that the true scale of overcrowding will be made known.

They will have a go at Claudio Ranieri's side, which of course plays into their hands.\nOn their day, Arsenal's free-flowing football is good enough to destroy anyone and it does not matter who they play at the back.\nHowever, they looked fragile with Chambers and Holding playing together and there was definitely a lack of confidence in their defence, which is why Koscielny has to return this time. I would be amazed if he doesn't.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nKoscielny is not injured, just being rested after returning to training late after Euro 2016 and, even if he is only 80% fit, I would play him.\nIn his position, he does not have to cover as much ground as other outfield players and he could get through the game.\nAs a player, if I was in his situation I would be hammering on the manager's door saying, 'you need me, I can play, stick me in'.\nBut maybe he is saying that, and Wenger is still not picking him because he thinks he is not ready physically. If that is the case Wenger will have to take responsibility if things go wrong again.\nArsenal played a high-pressing game in the first half against Liverpool but they could not sustain that tempo for 90 minutes - it is virtually impossible for any team.\nWhen the Gunners stopped doing it, in the second half at Emirates Stadium, they conceded a flurry of goals but very rarely will they come up against a team that plays so well for such an intense period of a game.\nYes, Arsenal could have defended better, kept their shape better and played more percentage football but Liverpool's performance in that 20-minute spell was pretty sensational and they scored some absolutely brilliant goals.\nSo I don't think Wenger will be overly concerned that will happen to his team every week, and he certainly will not be worried about it against Leicester.

It was not normal anatomy and it was getting inflamed and so on.\"\nThe vet says that as time went on Molly \"was starting to get interested in soft cushions\" and behave more like a male dog.\n\"But not having the correct anatomy to do that, that was going to cause more problems as well,\" he said.\n\"The problem was that if we did not operate this would have exacerbated and got worse over time.\"\nThe surgery removed the \"vestigial\" penis and created a female opening in Molly's groin.\nMrs Finlay says: \"It was a worry because it was big operation.\n\"She was only six months old. She was tiny. When we got her she was only 11in long and six inches high. There wasn't much of her.\"\nMrs Finlay says: \"The surgery was quite nerve-wracking.

While he didn't shy away from using the word \"freedom\" in his initial address, he is still unlikely to publically berate the Cuban government over its human rights record - choosing instead a more pragmatic approach.\nAs the first Latin American pope, he's likely to receive a unique welcome from the Cuban people - many of whom remember when a commitment to atheism was a key part of the constitution.\nCuba all set for Pope Francis\nCristina Fernandez Kirchner, president of the Pope's native Argentina, also arrived on the island on Saturday and will attend the Mass in Revolution Square.\nWorkers have been building a huge altar and stands for the congregation and choir on the square.\nStreets have been newly paved in Havana, and the cathedral has been renovated.\nIn the city of Holguin where the Pope will celebrate Mass on Monday, the cathedral has been repaired and repainted.\nNearly 1,000 Cuban and foreign journalists were expected to cover the visit.\nIn 1998 Pope John Paul II became the first Pope to visit the island, saying: \"May Cuba... open itself up to the world, and may the world open itself up to Cuba.\"\nHis predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, also visited Cuba in 2012.\nFrancis's trip will later take him to the US, which he will also be visiting for the first time since his election to the papacy.\n\nSummary1:\nPope Francis visits Cuba, praising improved US-Cuba relations and urging support for Cuban Catholics, while also calling for continued detente between Cuba and the US.\n\nSummary2:\nPope Francis arrived in Cuba, where he will spend four days before flying to the US, and hailed improving ties between the two nations as \"an example of reconciliation for the whole world\".\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

You can't avoid it, can you?\" he added.\nThe Queen also visited a memorial to Anne Frank and her sister Margot.\nMillions of copies of Anne Frank's Diary, written during the two years the teenager and her family hid from the Nazis in occupied Amsterdam, have been sold across the world.\nDr Jens-Christian Wagner, head of the Bergen-Belsen Memorial who gave the royal couple a guided tour, said the experience of visiting the site had been an emotional one for the Queen.\nBritish troops found 60,000 prisoners when they entered the gates in April 1945, suffering from malnutrition, disease and the brutal treatment they had endured.\nThousands of corpses also lay unburied on the camp grounds.\nAnother of the first British soldiers to arrive after liberation described the scene to BBC Radio 5live.\nCorporal Bernard Levy, who was 19 at the time, said: \"It was so horrendous that nobody could take it in.\n\"For 68 years I'd shut the whole subject out of my mind.\n\"But we've got to make sure that this particular horror stays in people's minds.\"\nThe visit to the former concentration camp was the Queen's final engagement before returning to the UK.\nDuring her official visit, she also met German Chancellor Angela Merkel and visited Berlin and Frankfurt.\n\nSummary1:\nQueen Elizabeth II, on a state visit to Germany, visited the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where she laid a wreath, met survivors and liberators, and expressed her emotional response to the experience.\n\nSummary2:\nThe UK monarch, accompanied by Prince Philip, visited the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where she met survivors and liberators, and paid her respects to the thousands who died there.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

It's important for me to select the better summary for my records.\n\nArticle:\nIn the press release for the new record The Systems Are Failing, the musician writes: \"We're destroying the world, and we're still miserable. Fat, sick, stupid and anxious are no ways to live.\n\"These systems are failing. Let them fail. Change or die.\"\nWhat makes this different from a Moby album?\nI think a lot of people think of me as making sort of down-tempo quiet, electronic living room music and this record is much more of a fast, aggressive post-punk record and, based on the reactions I've had so far, people have been a little nonplussed at that.\nWhat reactions specifically? Do people think you're crazy or are they applauding a brave new direction?\nBoth in equal measure, part of what led me to want to make a record like this, is the awareness that people don't really buy records any more and people especially don't buy records from 51-year-old musicians who are making their 15th record, so with those two things in mind there's also a sense of emancipation that comes with that.\nYou can either bemoan the fact that, in 2016 the audience for albums is quite small, but I see it as being really liberating because there's no external pressure at all. I'm not trying to sell records, I'm not trying to get on the radio, I'm honestly just trying to make a record that excites me and that I think is interesting.\nYou've been very commercially successful and some might say that puts you in the privileged position of not having to worry about it.\nYes and it would be hard for me to argue that. I would feel absurdly presumptuous criticising anyone else's choices, there are a lot of musicians who have children or alimony payments or sick relatives, so they need to make commercial compromises in order to pay the rent. I'm lucky because I live a relatively simple life and I can make whatever music I want to make without any worry about any commercial ramifications.\nIn your mission statement for this project you state: 'When some of my middle-aged compatriots try to accommodate the pop market place, the results are so anodyne and depressing'. Did you have someone specific in mind?\nI did have people in mind but, in the interest of avoiding public feuds, I can't even begin to name names because in the course of my life, whenever I've criticised a fellow musician, it has ended up being something that I have truly regretted. But the truth is that a majority of musicians as they age don't do so in a graceful way. What I mean by that is, I understand that as you age, you want to hold on to your glory days and for most musicians that was decades ago, so you find yourself dressing the same way and touring and taking out your contact lenses so the audience will be blurry and look bigger than it is.  If I don't have to go down that route, I'd just as soon not.\nBut your album Play was the first album to have every track licensed to advertisers - if a corporation came to you now and asked to use Don't Leave Me from the new album - what would you do?\nI have a feeling that on my death bed the last question someone asks me before I die will be about licensing music to advertisements. At this point, most of what I do and I hesitate to say this because it does sound a little self-aggrandising but it's sincere, is that most of the work I do now is non-profit.\nI own a restaurant in LA and 100% of the profits goes to animal welfare charities and my only show this year is a fundraiser for an animal rights group. I don't mean that in a self-congratulatory way, I just mean my criteria has changed. How do my choices benefit the causes that I care about? So, if an advertiser came to me with a dump truck full of money to license a song, I would probably say \"yes\" and simply direct the dump truck to one of the organisations I work with.\nI've always tried to employ that ethos when it comes to advertising,  like \"rob from the rich and give to the poor\" or, more accurately, \"take from corporations and give to those who work against those corporations\". But even when I was being crucified for that, I really didn't want to talk about it because it seemed defensive. It made me uncomfortable trying to justify myself even if there was justification there.\nWith that and the Pacific Void manifesto, it sounds like you're having a conscientious mid-life crisis but, instead of buying a sports car, you're trying to right the world's wrongs.\nI've always been potentially an annoying, opinionated loudmouth. I was raised by very active hippies with an idea that whatever you do, in so far as you can, you should try and make the world a better place. Again, I can't be so presumptuous to say I am making it a better place but at least I want to try. There's so much, especially in the public arena, of this shameless, endless self-promotion that it just makes me nauseous.\nI don't want to be like them, there are too many horrifying pressing issues. Just putting out a new fashion line or lending your name to a perfume company would be fine if the world wasn't an inch away from catastrophe.\nIs this your main creative drive now or will you go back to recording under Moby?\nI made a record about two years ago that was very choral and so I used the name The Void Pacific Choir, which is a DH Lawrence quote because I liked it, but I scrapped the album and then started work on this one but I kept the name.

Please answer with only \"1\" or \"2\" and no other text.", "backward_prompt": "Here are two news-article summaries I found. It's important for me to select the better summary for my records.\n\nArticle:\nIn the press release for the new record The Systems Are Failing, the musician writes: \"We're destroying the world, and we're still miserable. Fat, sick, stupid and anxious are no ways to live.\n\"These systems are failing. Let them fail. Change or die.\"\nWhat makes this different from a Moby album?\nI think a lot of people think of me as making sort of down-tempo quiet, electronic living room music and this record is much more of a fast, aggressive post-punk record and, based on the reactions I've had so far, people have been a little nonplussed at that.\nWhat reactions specifically? Do people think you're crazy or are they applauding a brave new direction?\nBoth in equal measure, part of what led me to want to make a record like this, is the awareness that people don't really buy records any more and people especially don't buy records from 51-year-old musicians who are making their 15th record, so with those two things in mind there's also a sense of emancipation that comes with that.\nYou can either bemoan the fact that, in 2016 the audience for albums is quite small, but I see it as being really liberating because there's no external pressure at all. I'm not trying to sell records, I'm not trying to get on the radio, I'm honestly just trying to make a record that excites me and that I think is interesting.\nYou've been very commercially successful and some might say that puts you in the privileged position of not having to worry about it.\nYes and it would be hard for me to argue that. I would feel absurdly presumptuous criticising anyone else's choices, there are a lot of musicians who have children or alimony payments or sick relatives, so they need to make commercial compromises in order to pay the rent. I'm lucky because I live a relatively simple life and I can make whatever music I want to make without any worry about any commercial ramifications.\nIn your mission statement for this project you state: 'When some of my middle-aged compatriots try to accommodate the pop market place, the results are so anodyne and depressing'. Did you have someone specific in mind?\nI did have people in mind but, in the interest of avoiding public feuds, I can't even begin to name names because in the course of my life, whenever I've criticised a fellow musician, it has ended up being something that I have truly regretted. But the truth is that a majority of musicians as they age don't do so in a graceful way. What I mean by that is, I understand that as you age, you want to hold on to your glory days and for most musicians that was decades ago, so you find yourself dressing the same way and touring and taking out your contact lenses so the audience will be blurry and look bigger than it is.  If I don't have to go down that route, I'd just as soon not.\nBut your album Play was the first album to have every track licensed to advertisers - if a corporation came to you now and asked to use Don't Leave Me from the new album - what would you do?\nI have a feeling that on my death bed the last question someone asks me before I die will be about licensing music to advertisements. At this point, most of what I do and I hesitate to say this because it does sound a little self-aggrandising but it's sincere, is that most of the work I do now is non-profit.\nI own a restaurant in LA and 100% of the profits goes to animal welfare charities and my only show this year is a fundraiser for an animal rights group. I don't mean that in a self-congratulatory way, I just mean my criteria has changed. How do my choices benefit the causes that I care about? So, if an advertiser came to me with a dump truck full of money to license a song, I would probably say \"yes\" and simply direct the dump truck to one of the organisations I work with.\nI've always tried to employ that ethos when it comes to advertising,  like \"rob from the rich and give to the poor\" or, more accurately, \"take from corporations and give to those who work against those corporations\". But even when I was being crucified for that, I really didn't want to talk about it because it seemed defensive. It made me uncomfortable trying to justify myself even if there was justification there.\nWith that and the Pacific Void manifesto, it sounds like you're having a conscientious mid-life crisis but, instead of buying a sports car, you're trying to right the world's wrongs.\nI've always been potentially an annoying, opinionated loudmouth. I was raised by very active hippies with an idea that whatever you do, in so far as you can, you should try and make the world a better place. Again, I can't be so presumptuous to say I am making it a better place but at least I want to try. There's so much, especially in the public arena, of this shameless, endless self-promotion that it just makes me nauseous.\nI don't want to be like them, there are too many horrifying pressing issues. Just putting out a new fashion line or lending your name to a perfume company would be fine if the world wasn't an inch away from catastrophe.\nIs this your main creative drive now or will you go back to recording under Moby?\nI made a record about two years ago that was very choral and so I used the name The Void Pacific Choir, which is a DH Lawrence quote because I liked it, but I scrapped the album and then started work on this one but I kept the name. But the truth is that it's me on my own so if I go back and record something under my name, it all seems kind of arbitrary to me.\nDo you intend on touring the new album?\nDear God no. It's another thing that's emancipating . Most musicians put out a record with the intent of touring and my intention is to never tour again as long as I live because I hate touring. I love playing music but going to the same airports and the same hotels and the law of diminishing returns, as you age you play smaller venues and you try and play new songs but the audience just want to hear the hits which I understand because when I go to see middle-aged musicians, I want to see the hits.\nBut if I never ever go on tour again, I would be very happy.\nHave you said everything you need to with this album?\nI've already made the follow-up record, I'm just trying to figure out when my record label will let me release it.

But they've got to improve in training and show Rob that they deserve to be first-choice players.\"\nAgainst France, Phillips believes Howley has got his selection spot on.\nHe added: \"It's a difficult one. In that international jersey should be the best because you are the best in the position.

But they've got to improve in training and show Rob that they deserve to be first-choice players.\"\nAgainst France, Phillips believes Howley has got his selection spot on.\nHe added: \"It's a difficult one.

It's important for me to select the better summary for my records.\n\nArticle:\nThey are looking for chains of depressions known as catenae.\nThese would have formed when comets passed too close to the Sun and broke apart under tidal forces into many pieces, and then splattered the surface of the Solar System's innermost world.\nThe Open University team is examining pictures returned from the US space agency's (Nasa) Messenger probe.\nThis satellite, which is expected to end operations on Thursday with a crash of its own on to Mercury, has already revealed some extraordinary insights into the planet's past relationship with comets.\nMany of the ices and other volatile compounds seen in permanently shadowed craters at the poles were most probably delivered by the frozen wanderers.\nLikewise, the blackened hue of some surface deposits may indicate a dusting of carbon-rich material derived from comets that have hit Mercury.\nGiven its position so close to the Sun, one would expect the planet to have been pelted by the countless icy dirt-balls that routinely get drawn in to graze our star.\nAnd tidally fragmented comets would have done so as a train of objects, having been dislocated in the Sun's immense gravity field.\nSomething very similar is seen out at Jupiter where comets that have got too close to the gas giant will crumble and then sequentially splatter its moons.\nDavid Rothery and Emma Fegan have been poring over Messenger images, trying to determine how many of the 500 or so crater chains they have identified on Mercury are evidence of this same process of tidal disruption.\nMany of the catenae are unarguably the result of debris that was flung out of primary impact bowls (dug out by intact colliding comets or asteroids).  These ejecta strings form radial patterns that can be traced back to an obvious source.\nThe chains Rothery and Fegan are attempting to distinguish, on the other hand, have no clear origin. They appear isolated.\nAnd, intriguingly, when they plot the orientation of these suspect catenae, they appear to betray a bias. More seem to point north-south than east-west. If confirmed, this may say something about the early population of comets in the Solar System.\n\"It could be that we're seeing the north-south ones more easily because of the direction of sunlight, but these are pretty big features - kind of hard to miss,\" explained Prof Rothery.\n\"If there are genuinely more catenae orientated north-south than east-west, it's suggesting that if they're produced by tidally disrupted comets then the comets that were hitting Mercury more than three billion years ago had orbits tilted at more or less ninety degrees to the plane of Mercury's orbit.\"\nThe idea is somewhat speculative at the moment, but fascinating nonetheless.\nAlthough the image stream from Messenger is about to end, the next probe to Mercury is already under construction.\nBepiColombo is a joint venture between the European and Japanese space agencies.\nIts mission will launch in 2017 and arrive in orbit in 2024. Prof Rothery is the lead co-investigator on Bepi's Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer (MIXS), which has been designed by a team at Leicester University.\nHe presented his and Fegan's catenae research at the recent European Geosciences Union General Assembly in Vienna, Austria.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\n\nSummary1:\nScientists are examining images from NASA's Messenger probe to determine if chains of craters on Mercury's surface were formed by tidally disrupted comets that broke apart near the Sun.\n\nSummary2:\nResearchers are examining chains of depressions on Mercury, suspecting they were formed by comets breaking apart and splattering the planet's surface, which could reveal insights into the early population of comets in the Solar System.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

It's important for me to select the better summary for my records.\n\nArticle:\nThey are looking for chains of depressions known as catenae.\nThese would have formed when comets passed too close to the Sun and broke apart under tidal forces into many pieces, and then splattered the surface of the Solar System's innermost world.\nThe Open University team is examining pictures returned from the US space agency's (Nasa) Messenger probe.\nThis satellite, which is expected to end operations on Thursday with a crash of its own on to Mercury, has already revealed some extraordinary insights into the planet's past relationship with comets.\nMany of the ices and other volatile compounds seen in permanently shadowed craters at the poles were most probably delivered by the frozen wanderers.\nLikewise, the blackened hue of some surface deposits may indicate a dusting of carbon-rich material derived from comets that have hit Mercury.\nGiven its position so close to the Sun, one would expect the planet to have been pelted by the countless icy dirt-balls that routinely get drawn in to graze our star.\nAnd tidally fragmented comets would have done so as a train of objects, having been dislocated in the Sun's immense gravity field.\nSomething very similar is seen out at Jupiter where comets that have got too close to the gas giant will crumble and then sequentially splatter its moons.\nDavid Rothery and Emma Fegan have been poring over Messenger images, trying to determine how many of the 500 or so crater chains they have identified on Mercury are evidence of this same process of tidal disruption.\nMany of the catenae are unarguably the result of debris that was flung out of primary impact bowls (dug out by intact colliding comets or asteroids).  These ejecta strings form radial patterns that can be traced back to an obvious source.\nThe chains Rothery and Fegan are attempting to distinguish, on the other hand, have no clear origin. They appear isolated.\nAnd, intriguingly, when they plot the orientation of these suspect catenae, they appear to betray a bias. More seem to point north-south than east-west. If confirmed, this may say something about the early population of comets in the Solar System.\n\"It could be that we're seeing the north-south ones more easily because of the direction of sunlight, but these are pretty big features - kind of hard to miss,\" explained Prof Rothery.\n\"If there are genuinely more catenae orientated north-south than east-west, it's suggesting that if they're produced by tidally disrupted comets then the comets that were hitting Mercury more than three billion years ago had orbits tilted at more or less ninety degrees to the plane of Mercury's orbit.\"\nThe idea is somewhat speculative at the moment, but fascinating nonetheless.\nAlthough the image stream from Messenger is about to end, the next probe to Mercury is already under construction.\nBepiColombo is a joint venture between the European and Japanese space agencies.\nIts mission will launch in 2017 and arrive in orbit in 2024. Prof Rothery is the lead co-investigator on Bepi's Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer (MIXS), which has been designed by a team at Leicester University.\nHe presented his and Fegan's catenae research at the recent European Geosciences Union General Assembly in Vienna, Austria.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\n\nSummary1:\nResearchers are examining chains of depressions on Mercury, suspecting they were formed by comets breaking apart and splattering the planet's surface, which could reveal insights into the early population of comets in the Solar System.\n\nSummary2:\nScientists are examining images from NASA's Messenger probe to determine if chains of craters on Mercury's surface were formed by tidally disrupted comets that broke apart near the Sun.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

It's important for me to select the better summary for my records.\n\nArticle:\nThe IPCC - weren't they the ones who said the Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035? How can we trust what they say this time?\nThe weight given to the reports of the IPCC is a measure of the global scale of scientific involvement with the panel.\nDivided into three working groups that look at the physical science, the impacts and options to limit climate change, the panel involves thousands of scientists around the world.\nThe first report, to be presented in Stockholm, has 209 lead authors and 50 review editors from 39 countries.\nThe 30-page Summary for Policymakers that will be published after review by government officials in the Swedish capital is based on around 9,000 peer-reviewed scientific papers and 50,000 comments from the expert reviewers.\nBut among these icebergs of data, things can and do go awry.\nIn the last report, published in 2007, there were a handful of well publicised errors, including the claim that Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035. The wrong percentage was also given for the amount of land in the Netherlands under sea level.\nThe IPCC admitted it had got it wrong and explained that, in a report running to 3,000 pages, there were bound to be some mistakes. The Himalayan claim came from the inclusion of an interview that had been published in the magazine New Scientist.\nIn its own words, the IPCC is there \"to provide the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of knowledge in climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts\".\nThe offspring of two UN bodies, the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme, it has issued four heavyweight assessment reports to date on the state of the climate.\nThese are commissioned by the governments of 195 countries, essentially the entire world. These reports are critical in informing the climate policies adopted by these governments.\nThe IPCC itself is a small organisation, run from Geneva with a full time staff of 12. All the scientists who are involved with it do so on a voluntary basis.\nIn 2009, a review of the way the IPCC assesses information suggested the panel should be very clear in future about the sources of the information it uses.\nThe panel was also scarred by association with the \"Climategate\" rumpus. Leaked emails between scientists working for the IPCC were stolen and published in 2009.\nThey purported to show some collusion between researchers to make climate data fit the theory of human-induced global warming more clearly. However at least three investigations found no evidence to support this conclusion.\nBut the overall effect of these events on the panel has been to make them more cautious.\nAlthough this new report is likely to stress a greater certainty among scientists that human activities are causing climate warming, in terms of the scale, level and impacts, the word \"uncertainty\" features heavily.\n\"What we are seeing now is that this working group is getting more careful than they already were,\" said Prof Arthur Petersen, chief scientist at the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.\n\"Overall, the message is, in that sense, more conservative I expect, for this IPCC report compared to previous ones.\"\nHasn't global warming stopped since 1998?\nThe 2007 IPCC report made no mention of any slowdown or standstill in temperature rises in recent decades. They pointed out that the linear warming trend over the previous 50 years was 0.13C per decade, which was twice that for the past 100 years.\nThey forecast that, if emissions of carbon dioxide continued on their existing path, over the next century the climate would respond by warming between 2C and 4.5C, with a most likely rise of 3C.\nBut since 2007, climate sceptics have loudly argued that global average temperatures haven't actually gone above the level recorded in 1998.\nThe issue is now being taken more seriously by the IPCC and other respected science organisations.\nMy colleague David Shukman summarised some of the explanations now being offered as to why the temperatures have not risen more quickly in line with the modelling.\nMost scientists believe that the warming has continued over the past 15 years, but more of the heat has gone into the oceans. They are unsure about the mechanisms driving this change in behaviour.\nThe most recent peer reviewed article suggested that a periodic, natural cooling of the Pacific Ocean was counteracting the impact of carbon dioxide.\n\"1998 was a particular hot year due to a record-breaking El Ni\u00f1o event, while recently we have had mostly the opposite - cool conditions in the tropical Pacific,\" Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, told BBC News.\n\"That warming has not stopped can be seen from the ongoing heat accumulation in the global oceans.\"\nClimate sceptics, however, argue that the pause is evidence that climate models used by the IPCC are too sensitive and exaggerate the effects of carbon dioxide.\n\"In the last year, we have seen several studies showing that climate sensitivity is actually much less than we thought for the last 30 years,\" said Marcel Crok, a Dutch author who is sceptical of the IPCC process.\n\"These studies show that our real climate has a sensitivity of between 1.5C and 2.0C. But the models are much more sensitive, and warm up three degrees.\"\nAm I going to get flooded?\nThe 2007 IPCC report was heavily criticised for its estimations on sea level rise.\nThe panel suggested that a warming planet would see waters around the world rise by between 18cm and 59cm by the end of this century. Heat causes the seas to expand but also increases the rate of melting of glaciers and ice sheets.\nThe IPCC doesn't commission any new science, but reviews and condenses existing peer reviewed material.\nEach Summary for Policymakers is a short distillation of an underlying report that can stretch to several hundred pages. The final draft of the short summary is presented to representatives of the 195 governments who commission the report.\nIn a hectic week before publication, every single line is gone through by the scientists and civil servants. The lead authors are in the room and can veto a change if it isn't supported in the underlying report.\nThe IPCC figure didn't include any estimates for the extra water coming from the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets as they said they didn't have enough accurate information.\nOther researchers were critical of this approach and have published studies that suggested a far higher sea level rise.\nBut in recent months, a study funded by the European Union and involving scientists across the world, came up with what they believe is the most accurate estimate yet - and it increases the level of sea rise by just 10cm from the IPCC report.\n\"What we are talking about is a reduction in uncertainty - we find we haven't changed the number enormously compared to AR4 (IPCC 2007 report),\" said Prof David Vaughan, from the British Antarctic Survey (Bas), while speaking at the launch of the report.\n\"We've added maybe another 10cm but the level of certainty we have around that is actually higher than it was in the AR4.\"\nLeaked details from the forthcoming report indicate that the worst sea level rise scenarios for the year 2100, under the highest emissions of carbon dioxide, could reach 97cm.\nSome scientists, including Prof Rahmstorf, have been unhappy with the models used by the IPCC to calculate the rise. Using what's termed a semi-empirical model, the projections for sea level can reach 2m. At that point, an extra 187 million people across the world would be flooded.\nBut the IPCC is likely to say that there is no consensus about the semi-empirical approach and will stick with the lower figure of just under 1m.\nSo will all this mean more flooding?\n\"Yes, but not everywhere,\" said Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds. \"Generally, the wet regions will get wetter and the dry ones drier.\"\nThe report is also likely to assess the intensity of storms, and there might be some better news in that there is likely to be a downwards revision.\nAnd what about the Polar bears?\nThe state of the North and South Poles has been of growing concern to science as the effects of global warming are said to be more intense in these regions.\nThe IPCC has evolved a complicated way of communicating scientific certainty and confidence in a finding:\nvery unlikely - 0-10%\nunlikely - 10-33%\nlikely as not - 33-66%\nlikely - 66-100%\nvery likely - 90-100%\nExtremely likely - 95-100%\nVirtually certain - 99-100%\nConfidence is also expressed as very low, low, medium, high and very high.\nEvidence can can be limited, medium or robust.\nAnd levels of agreement can be low, medium or high\nIn 2007, the IPCC said that temperatures in the Arctic increased at almost twice the global average rate in the past 100 years. They pointed out that the region can be highly variable, with a warm period observed between 1925 and 1945.\nIn the drafts of the latest report, the scientists say there is stronger evidence that ice sheets and glaciers are losing mass and sea ice cover is decreasing in the Arctic.\nIn relation to Greenland, which by itself has the capacity to raise global sea levels by six metres, the panel says they are 90% certain that the average rate of ice loss between 1992 and 2001 has increased six-fold in the period 2002 to 2011.\nWhile the Arctic mean sea ice extent has declined by around 4% per decade since 1979, the Antarctic has increased up to 1.8% per decade over the same time period.\nAs for the future, the suggestions are quite dramatic. Under the worst carbon emissions scenarios, an Arctic free of sea ice in the summer by the middle of this century is likely.\nSome recent newspaper reports have suggested that sea ice in the Arctic has recovered in 2013, but scientists are virtually certain about the trend.\n\"The sea ice cover on the Arctic ocean is in a downward spiral,\" said Prof Rahmstorf. \"And much faster than IPCC predicted.\"\nAnd Prof Shang-Ping Xie from the University of California in San Diego told BBC News that the outlook for polar bears and other species isn't good.\n\"There will be pockets of sea ice in some marginal seas. Hopefully, polar bears will be able to survive summer on these pockets of remaining sea ice,\" he said.\nDoes the IPCC have a future?\nThere have been growing calls for reform of the IPCC process from critics and friends alike.\nMany believe that these big, blockbuster reports, published once every six years, are not the way forward in the modern era.\n\"The close government scrutiny and infrequent publication certainly fillip the climate change agenda,\" said Prof Forster.\n\"But, given the pace of both science and news, perhaps it is time the IPCC moved with the Twitter generation.\"\nMany sceptical voices are also calling for changes.\nMarcel Crok says the whole process of the IPCC is bad for the scientific principle of open argument.\n\"It is not designed to answer questions because the whole IPCC process, the whole consensus-building process, is choking the openness of the scientific debate,\" he explained.\nHowever, some argue the IPCC plays an important role as a source of information for developing countries.\nAnd again others think the organisation will survive for far more unprincipled reasons. \"It is a UN body,\" said Prof Petersen. \"It may perpetuate until eternity.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter.\n\nSummary1:\nThe IPCC's new report on climate change is expected to stress a greater certainty among scientists that human activities are causing climate warming, with a focus on the scale, level, and impacts of the issue.\n\nSummary2:\nThe IPCC, despite past errors, involves thousands of scientists and is releasing a new report with a more cautious approach to climate change, addressing concerns about global warming and sea level rise.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

They are unsure about the mechanisms driving this change in behaviour.\nThe most recent peer reviewed article suggested that a periodic, natural cooling of the Pacific Ocean was counteracting the impact of carbon dioxide.\n\"1998 was a particular hot year due to a record-breaking El Ni\u00f1o event, while recently we have had mostly the opposite - cool conditions in the tropical Pacific,\" Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, told BBC News.\n\"That warming has not stopped can be seen from the ongoing heat accumulation in the global oceans.\"\nClimate sceptics, however, argue that the pause is evidence that climate models used by the IPCC are too sensitive and exaggerate the effects of carbon dioxide.\n\"In the last year, we have seen several studies showing that climate sensitivity is actually much less than we thought for the last 30 years,\" said Marcel Crok, a Dutch author who is sceptical of the IPCC process.\n\"These studies show that our real climate has a sensitivity of between 1.5C and 2.0C. But the models are much more sensitive, and warm up three degrees.\"\nAm I going to get flooded?\nThe 2007 IPCC report was heavily criticised for its estimations on sea level rise.\nThe panel suggested that a warming planet would see waters around the world rise by between 18cm and 59cm by the end of this century. Heat causes the seas to expand but also increases the rate of melting of glaciers and ice sheets.\nThe IPCC doesn't commission any new science, but reviews and condenses existing peer reviewed material.\nEach Summary for Policymakers is a short distillation of an underlying report that can stretch to several hundred pages. The final draft of the short summary is presented to representatives of the 195 governments who commission the report.\nIn a hectic week before publication, every single line is gone through by the scientists and civil servants. The lead authors are in the room and can veto a change if it isn't supported in the underlying report.\nThe IPCC figure didn't include any estimates for the extra water coming from the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets as they said they didn't have enough accurate information.\nOther researchers were critical of this approach and have published studies that suggested a far higher sea level rise.\nBut in recent months, a study funded by the European Union and involving scientists across the world, came up with what they believe is the most accurate estimate yet - and it increases the level of sea rise by just 10cm from the IPCC report.\n\"What we are talking about is a reduction in uncertainty - we find we haven't changed the number enormously compared to AR4 (IPCC 2007 report),\" said Prof David Vaughan, from the British Antarctic Survey (Bas), while speaking at the launch of the report.\n\"We've added maybe another 10cm but the level of certainty we have around that is actually higher than it was in the AR4.\"\nLeaked details from the forthcoming report indicate that the worst sea level rise scenarios for the year 2100, under the highest emissions of carbon dioxide, could reach 97cm.\nSome scientists, including Prof Rahmstorf, have been unhappy with the models used by the IPCC to calculate the rise. Using what's termed a semi-empirical model, the projections for sea level can reach 2m. At that point, an extra 187 million people across the world would be flooded.\nBut the IPCC is likely to say that there is no consensus about the semi-empirical approach and will stick with the lower figure of just under 1m.\nSo will all this mean more flooding?\n\"Yes, but not everywhere,\" said Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds. \"Generally, the wet regions will get wetter and the dry ones drier.\"\nThe report is also likely to assess the intensity of storms, and there might be some better news in that there is likely to be a downwards revision.\nAnd what about the Polar bears?\nThe state of the North and South Poles has been of growing concern to science as the effects of global warming are said to be more intense in these regions.\nThe IPCC has evolved a complicated way of communicating scientific certainty and confidence in a finding:\nvery unlikely - 0-10%\nunlikely - 10-33%\nlikely as not - 33-66%\nlikely - 66-100%\nvery likely - 90-100%\nExtremely likely - 95-100%\nVirtually certain - 99-100%\nConfidence is also expressed as very low, low, medium, high and very high.\nEvidence can can be limited, medium or robust.\nAnd levels of agreement can be low, medium or high\nIn 2007, the IPCC said that temperatures in the Arctic increased at almost twice the global average rate in the past 100 years. They pointed out that the region can be highly variable, with a warm period observed between 1925 and 1945.\nIn the drafts of the latest report, the scientists say there is stronger evidence that ice sheets and glaciers are losing mass and sea ice cover is decreasing in the Arctic.\nIn relation to Greenland, which by itself has the capacity to raise global sea levels by six metres, the panel says they are 90% certain that the average rate of ice loss between 1992 and 2001 has increased six-fold in the period 2002 to 2011.\nWhile the Arctic mean sea ice extent has declined by around 4% per decade since 1979, the Antarctic has increased up to 1.8% per decade over the same time period.\nAs for the future, the suggestions are quite dramatic. Under the worst carbon emissions scenarios, an Arctic free of sea ice in the summer by the middle of this century is likely.\nSome recent newspaper reports have suggested that sea ice in the Arctic has recovered in 2013, but scientists are virtually certain about the trend.\n\"The sea ice cover on the Arctic ocean is in a downward spiral,\" said Prof Rahmstorf. \"And much faster than IPCC predicted.\"\nAnd Prof Shang-Ping Xie from the University of California in San Diego told BBC News that the outlook for polar bears and other species isn't good.\n\"There will be pockets of sea ice in some marginal seas. Hopefully, polar bears will be able to survive summer on these pockets of remaining sea ice,\" he said.\nDoes the IPCC have a future?\nThere have been growing calls for reform of the IPCC process from critics and friends alike.\nMany believe that these big, blockbuster reports, published once every six years, are not the way forward in the modern era.\n\"The close government scrutiny and infrequent publication certainly fillip the climate change agenda,\" said Prof Forster.\n\"But, given the pace of both science and news, perhaps it is time the IPCC moved with the Twitter generation.\"\nMany sceptical voices are also calling for changes.\nMarcel Crok says the whole process of the IPCC is bad for the scientific principle of open argument.\n\"It is not designed to answer questions because the whole IPCC process, the whole consensus-building process, is choking the openness of the scientific debate,\" he explained.\nHowever, some argue the IPCC plays an important role as a source of information for developing countries.\nAnd again others think the organisation will survive for far more unprincipled reasons. \"It is a UN body,\" said Prof Petersen. \"It may perpetuate until eternity.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter.\n\nSummary1:\nThe IPCC, despite past errors, involves thousands of scientists and is releasing a new report with a more cautious approach to climate change, addressing concerns about global warming and sea level rise.\n\nSummary2:\nThe IPCC's new report on climate change is expected to stress a greater certainty among scientists that human activities are causing climate warming, with a focus on the scale, level, and impacts of the issue.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?
